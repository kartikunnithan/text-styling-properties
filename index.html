        What is typography?
    </p>
    <p class="text2">
Typography is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing
to the reader. Typography involves font style, appearance, and structure, which aims to elicit certain emotions and
convey specific messages. In short, typography is what brings the text to life.
